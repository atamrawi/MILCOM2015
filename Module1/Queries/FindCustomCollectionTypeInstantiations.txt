Problem Statement: Find all calls within the app to custom collection type constructors.  Define a custom collection type
                   to be a class that inherits from java.util.Collection and is defined within the app (your project).

// define the “app” to be everything declared under MyProject
var containsEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Contains).retainEdges()
var app = containsEdges.forward(universe.project(“MyProject”))

// grab a reference to the java.util.Collection class node
var collection = typeSelect("java.util", "Collection")

// create a subgraph of all SUPERTYPE edges in the universe, discard nodes not attached to the SUPERTYPE edges
var supertypeEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Supertype).retainEdges()

// find all subtypes (children) of java.util.Collection
var allCollectionTypes = supertypeEdges.reverse(collection)

// find all subtypes of java.util.Collection that were also defined in the app (not in the Java APIs)
var appCollectionTypes = allCollectionTypes.intersection(app)

// create a subgraph of all DECLARES edges in the universe, discard nodes not attached to the CONTAINS edges
var containsEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Contains).retainEdges()

// find all the methods, variables, etc declared under the app's custom collection types
var appCollectionDeclarations = containsEdges.forward(appCollectionTypes)

// pick out all the constructor's from the app collection declarations
var appCollectionConstructors = appCollectionDeclarations.nodesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Constructor)

// create a subgraph of all CALL edges in the universe, discard nodes not attached to the CALL edges
var callEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Call).retainEdges()

// find app methods that directly call the app collection constructors and discard constructors that are not called by the app
var appConstructorCalls = callEdges.reverseStep(appCollectionConstructors).retainEdges();

// create a highlighter to color the constructors red
var h = new Highlighter()
h.highlight(appCollectionConstructors, Color.RED)

// show the app constructor colors with the constructors colored red
show(appConstructorCalls, h)
