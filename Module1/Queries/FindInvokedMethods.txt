Problem Statement: Let methods B and F be sensitive methods.  Return the sensitive methods that are called.

var B = app.methods("B")
var F = app.methods("F")
var sensitive = B.union(F)
var callEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Call).retainEdges()
show(callEdges.reverseStep(sensitive).leaves())
